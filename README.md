Wikivoyage extracts
===================

Wikivoyage (the Wikimedia-backed collaboratively-edited tourism guide) has lists of restaurants/hotels/bars/attractions for each destination of the world.

The goal of this project is to extract all restaurants/hotels/bars/attractions (and their name/address/description/etc) from Wikivoyage and publish the data in reusable formats.

Download the data: http://datahub.io/organization/wikivoyage

Formats:

- OBF: Import into OsmAnd (or other navigation apps) to have all listings available on your smartphone, even when offline
- CSV: Low-tech way to import the data into your app, or to just read the data with LibreOffice
- OSM: Mix with OpenStreetMap-compatible databases

Like [Wikivoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org), the data is licensed Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Licensed, contributors can be found in each article's history.

If you like this data, please contribute back by adding latitudes/longitude to listings that don't have them yet, thanks :-)
